* Picasa Gallery Gadget (PiGGa) *

This package provides a Google Gadget to visualize a Javascript gallery, it is a small fix from Anton Shevchuk's package that in turn used Jondesign's Smoothgallery.

I've added a few options to the widget setup like ability to turn slideshow on and off, setup delay between photos, switch decorations on and off.
Moreover I'm hosting this on a public repository to make the gadget easily accessible.

* Why *

Because default picasa gallery widget uses flash and that doesn't work on iOS devices and other systems without a flash player. Luckily seems we're saying goodbye to Flash.

* How to use *

Choose the "add gadgets by url" option when adding a gadget and paste the link to pigga.xml. Default values will show a public gallery from the Picasa Team account.
