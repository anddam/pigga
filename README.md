= Picasa Google Gadget =

*Pigga* (PIcasa Google GAdget) is a Google Gadget that displays a javascript photo gallery from a Picasa album.
Make your galleries visible on iOS and other devices without Flash support.

This package is a fix from Anton Shevchuk's photogallery that in turn used Jondesign's Smoothgallery and MooTools. Licenses and info are in source tree.

I've added a few options to the widget setup: turn slideshow on and off, setup delay between photos, switch decorations on and off.
Moreover I'm hosting this on a Googlecode project to make the gadget easily accessible.

= Usage =

When adding the gadget choose "add by url" and paste the direct link to the gadget's XML file:
{{{
http://pigga.googlecode.com/hg/pigga.xml
}}}

Default values will show a public gallery from the Picasa Team account.

= Why =

Existing photogallery wasn't working when I tried it and its hosting wasn't always accessible.

Furthermore there's no need for a reason to dislike Flash.
